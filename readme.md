# Microsoft: DEV201x Introduction to TypeScript

With the announce that Angular 2.0 will now be built with TypeScript, and that TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, with ES6 features (VERY important to me - I <3 JavaScript), I decided to take this course.
